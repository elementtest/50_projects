LANDING PAGE NOTES

HTML

container div

and inside have split left with an h1

make the h1 a link using href


inside have another div split right same thing... h1 that has a link 

CSS:

dont use flex

.container {

position relative 
width and height 100%
????


.split 
position: absolute
again seeing this.. the child element inside the container is positioned absolute 

width 50% 
height 100%
overflow hidden 

.split.left
left: 0
?? i think this will be just no space in between just right up next to the left side of the window

.split.right {
right: 0
background: url('xbox.jpg')
!! this is weird... url can be used for local files

background-repeat: no-repeat
background-size: cover
??

OVERLAYS:::

.spli.left::before {
//PSUEDO SELECTOR
!!think of thi as a GHOST ELEMENT
a ghost element you are placing over the left side
remember that you need content for pseudo selectors
content: ''
position: absolute
width 100%
height 100%
background-color:  var(--left-bg-color)

define in root scope at the top

:root {
--left-bg-color: rgba(87, 84, 236, 0.7)
--right-bg-color: rgba(43, 43, 43, 0.7)
rgba 
?????


so youre just using like a cover as an overlay for each side of the page... 



rem unit
?????
look into difference between em and rem
???

again child positioned absolute in relative container

 transform translatex 
?????
needs some work, needs some exercises maybe 

text-decoration: none
remove underline
