#project for picking random choices....

type choices out and it will generate buttons of the choices below the input dialogue... as soon as you hit enter it will generate a dice effect of cycling through the choice boxes and then will stop on a random choice 

basically a fun way of wheel of fortuning a choice when you dont know which one to pick.  

sounds like a cool project
