preliminary notes::
goal this project is a bit different.. take notes first as he codes THEN code along with the solution looking up what needs to be looked up

search widget click an icon and you can see a search bar increase 

HTML

CSS

basically you want to have a class of active 
when it is active the input will expand and the button will move over

background image linear gradient ??????

.search 

position relative so you can position things inside of it as absolute

height: 

.search .input 

background color white #fff
border: 0 takes away the border
font size makes it bigger

padding: 15px all around

height: 50px

width: 50px

transition:  width 0.3s ease
???????

font size for the icon;;;;;
!!!!!
will increase the SIZE OF THE ICON.. not obvious

position the child as absolute... 

transition effect on the btn itself.. 
you want the button to move over

you want to push the button over

transition transform
??????????

outline delete
btn:focus, input:focus
outline none
wont see the outline

.search.active 
this means the search class WHEN IT HAS AN ACIVE CLASS

.search.active .input
want the input to go to 200px... when the search element is active THEN 
it will go to 200

.search.active .btn 
transform traslateX(198px) 
moving over on the x axis how many pixels.  

JAVASCRIPT:

btn add event listener... search classList.. toggle not remove.. 

classList.toggle
?????????

input.focus()
!!!!!!
adding this inside of the event listener will make it so that it will focus the mouse bar will be flashing on and off inside of the search icon.. 
good thing to know have a DOM element and focus() it when an event listener happens 

!!!!!
you can see from the projects we have done

its all just putting specific classes thru our javascript add or remove or toggle a class
THEN you have a transition to give us a cool little animation
